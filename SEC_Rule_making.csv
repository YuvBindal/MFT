The proposed amendments are designed to improve liquidity risk management programs to better prepare funds for stressed conditions and improve transparency in liquidity classifications. The amendments are also designed to mitigate dilution of shareholders' interests in a fund by requiring any open-end fund, other than a money market fund or exchange-traded fund, to use swing pricing to adjust a fund's net asset value (""NAV') per share to pass on costs stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to the shareholders engaged in that activity. In addition, to help operationalize the proposed swing pricing requirement, and to improve order processing more generally, the Commission is proposing a ""hard close' requirement for these funds. Under this requirement, an order to purchase or redeem a fund's shares would be executed at the current day's price only if the fund, its designated transfer agent, or a registered securities clearing agency receives the order before the pricing time as of which the fund calculates its NAV. The Commission also is proposing amendments to reporting and disclosure requirements on Forms N-PORT, N-1A, and N-CEN that apply to certain registered investment companies, including registered open-end funds (other than money market funds), registered closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts.

Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF,N/A,https://sec.gov/rules/2014/07/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-form-pf#33-9408,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission' or ""SEC') is adopting amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds (or ""money market funds') under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (""Investment Company Act' or ""Act'). The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (""NAV'), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a ""floating' NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion to impose a liquidity fee if a fund's weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to ""gate' funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund's weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund's board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC."

Certain Broker-Dealers Deemed Not To Be Investment Advisers,N/A,https://sec.gov/rules/2005/01/certain-broker-dealers-deemed-not-be-investment-advisers#34-51523,"The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting a rule addressing the application of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to broker-dealers offering certain types of brokerage programs. Under the rule, a broker-dealer providing advice that is solely incidental to its brokerage services is excepted from the Advisers Act if it charges an asset-based or fixed fee (rather than a commission, mark-up, or mark- down) for its services, provided it makes certain disclosures about the nature of its services. The rule states that exercising investment discretion is not ""solely incidental to' the business of a broker or dealer within the meaning of the Advisers Act or to brokerage services within the meaning of the rule. The rule also states that a broker or dealer provides investment advice that is not solely incidental to the conduct of its business as a broker or dealer or to its brokerage services if the broker or dealer charges a separate fee or separately contracts for advisory services. In addition, the rule states that when a broker-dealer provides advice as part of a financial plan or in connection with providing planning services, a broker-dealer provides advice that is not solely incidental if it: holds itself out to the public as a financial planner or as providing financial planning services; or delivers to its customer a financial plan; or represents to the customer that the advice is provided as part of a financial plan or financial planning services. Finally, under the rule, broker-dealers are not subject to the Advisers Act solely because they offer full- service brokerage and discount brokerage services (including electronic brokerage) for reduced commission rates."

Certain Broker-Dealers Deemed Not To Be Investment Advisers,N/A,https://sec.gov/rules/2005/01/certain-broker-dealers-deemed-not-be-investment-advisers#34-51523,"The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting a rule addressing the application of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to broker-dealers offering certain types of brokerage programs. Under the rule, a broker-dealer providing advice that is solely incidental to its brokerage services is excepted from the Advisers Act if it charges an asset-based or fixed fee (rather than a commission, mark-up, or mark- down) for its services, provided it makes certain disclosures about the nature of its services. The rule states that exercising investment discretion is not ""solely incidental to' the business of a broker or dealer within the meaning of the Advisers Act or to brokerage services within the meaning of the rule. The rule also states that a broker or dealer provides investment advice that is not solely incidental to the conduct of its business as a broker or dealer or to its brokerage services if the broker or dealer charges a separate fee or separately contracts for advisory services. In addition, the rule states that when a broker-dealer provides advice as part of a financial plan or in connection with providing planning services, a broker-dealer provides advice that is not solely incidental if it: holds itself out to the public as a financial planner or as providing financial planning services; or delivers to its customer a financial plan; or represents to the customer that the advice is provided as part of a financial plan or financial planning services. Finally, under the rule, broker-dealers are not subject to the Advisers Act solely because they offer full- service brokerage and discount brokerage services (including electronic brokerage) for reduced commission rates."

Our hope was fueled by the fact that many commenters offered excellent insights and recommendations to the Commission.  We are disappointed that the majority, unmoved by the chorus of credible concerns from diverse voices,2 has determined to adopt the hedge fund registration rules largely as proposed.3  As discussed below, we continue to agree that we need more information on hedge funds, but we disagree with the majority's solution."
