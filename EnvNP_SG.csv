ABOUT Kampung Kampus Ground-Up Initiative (GUI) is a non-profit community, guided by the spirit of innovation, resilience and grounded leadership to demonstrate urban sustainability. With the power of community, GUI is building Kampung Kampus, a low-carbon footprint community campus, sited on a 2.6 hectares land plot in Yishun, Singapore. Kampung Kampus aims to be a role model in sustainable living and a School of Life; nurturing an eco-conscious community with the mind, the hands and the heart to be stewards of a more sustainable and happier future.      Kampung Kampus   Interview with CAI Bingyu of Ground Up Initiative Interview Transcript Q1: Ever since you joined GUI, how has it affected or improved your life? I appreciate how things come together a lot more. One thing is the government (support).  For instance, GUI has very limited resources, hence we have to do things very differently. In a way that is more creative, and we have to think out of the box and adapt. The situation changes frequently in a social enterprise like ours and I really appreciate what the country leaders are doing. For instance, during the Covid lockdown, operations at Orto had to close and this caused the pests like rats to come over to GUI where they ate all the produce. As such we now have a pest infestation and we had to adapt and improvise to counter against these unforeseen circumstances. It is not easy to run a nation/company well and there are a lot of things to consider. All of these really make me appreciate things more. In GUI, at the start I thought what I’ll be doing could save the world but at the end all I want is to be a better son, a better husband, a better father to my daughter, as well as a better person for this world.  Q2: What is the proce            ","Ground Up Initiative (GUI) is a non-profit community organization dedicated to demonstrating urban sustainability through innovation, resilience, and grounded leadership. Guided by a vision of a more sustainable and happier future, GUI is committed to nurturing an eco-conscious community with practical skills and a profound understanding of environmental stewardship.

VisionsMulti-tasking comes naturally to Ann Phua, founder of Hemispheres Foundation — from championing major causes like protecting the environment and providing education to children, to housing the homeless, providing clean water to villagers and empowering women to make time for their loved ones.    By Swapna Mitter    It was her love for nature that led Ann Phua to set up the Hemispheres Foundation (hemispheresfund.org) in 1996. She had a clear goal in mind — to provide environmental education to children, and through them, educate the larger community.  The foundation, a social enterprise run by a small team of Singaporeans and expatriate professionals in Singapore, has reached out to more than 500,000 children, bringing into focus issues like global warming and environmental waste.  Hemispheres spearheads campaigns in developing nations like Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar, with Phua travelling to these countries to spread the message among the locals to be more environmentally conscious.  The indomitable 63-year-old also chairs the International Women’s Federation of Commerce and Industry Singapore (IWFCIS) — a global business network that provides women entrepreneurs access and resources to participate in business and networking opportunities.   Improving Women’s Lot  “In every culture, in every part of the world, women have always multi-tasked, working quietly behind the scenes to improve the lives of their families and the wider community. We want to recognise these unsung heroes — women with guts to follow their passion in business,” says Phua.    “... we hope to inspire other women that they too can be extraordinary.”    In 2012, IWFCIS instituted the Xtraordinary Women Award which recognises and honours women who successfully manage the domestic front while making a mark as entrepreneurs and social activists. Phua says that what makes a woman extraordinary is “selflessness and belief in family values”.  Phua adds that this award is not about self-gl","Hemispheres Foundation, founded by Ann Phua in 1996, is a Singapore-based social enterprise dedicated to environmental protection and education. The foundation aims to empower individuals, particularly children, with environmental knowledge through various programs and campaigns. Additionally, Hemispheres engages in humanitarian efforts in developing nations such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar, promoting environmental awareness and providing support to communities. Beyond its environmental focus, Hemispheres also advocates for women's empowerment through the International Women's Federation of Commerce and Industry Singapore (IWFCIS). IWFCIS serves as a business network that connects women entrepreneurs and provides resources to support their participation in the business world. The organization recognizes and celebrates exceptional women through its Xtraordinary Women Award, honoring those who successfully balance their professional achievements with their family responsibilities and social contributions. Hemispheres Foundation and IWFCIS strive to inspire and empower individuals by recognizing and supporting their efforts in various areas, from environmental conservation to women's advancement."

Started by WWF-Singapore, PACT (Plastic ACTion) is a voluntary, business initiative to eliminate plastic pollution in nature and towards a circular economy on plastics where no materials are wasted. PACT recognises the integral role that businesses have in the production and consumption of plastics globally, and the need for more accountability for the plastics these businesses introduce into the market.      With growing momentum across the world against plastics, businesses have been looking to take action. However, we need to avoid incomplete or fragmented measures like replacing plastics with materials that can have a higher environmental footprint, or alternatives that might lead to worse environmental outcomes. Under the PACT initiative, WWFs team works with businesses, to provide advice, assistance and helps them take science-based decisions every step of the way. As part of PACT, which is supported by the National Environment Agency and Zero Waste SG, over 270 food and beverage (F&B) outlets in Singapore will phase out plastic straws by 1 July 2019, in a major industry push to reduce the use of plastic disposables. The F&B outlets will remove straws completely from their premises or provide them only on request.   going straw-free by 1 July 2019    A Poke Theory Accor Group (Raffles, Swissotel, Fairmont, SO, Sofitel, Grand Mercure, Novotel, Mercure, Ibis, Ibis Styles) Bettr Barista Brawn & Brains Coffee Carrotsticks & Cravings Foreword Coffee Grand Hyatt Singapore Guzman Y Gomez iFood Pte Ltd (Good News Cafe, Providence Cafe) Jones the Grocer      Kraftwich Lo & Behold (Loof, Over Easy, White Rabbit, Tanjong Beach Club, Rabbit Hole, Extra Virgin Pizza, Black Swan, Odette, Le Bon Funk, Straits Clan, Clan cafe, Esora) Nam Nam Nandos Nylon Coffee Roasters PastaMania Plain Vanilla Bakery Ramada Days SaladStop!

Its mission is to extend the lifespan of used pens that would otherwise end up in landfills. Through collection drives in Singapore, Save That Pen gathers pens that are no longer needed and undertakes the task of refilling them. These renewed pens are then distributed to underprivileged students in Singapore and beyond, ensuring access to essential writing materials. Recognizing the challenges in recycling pens, Save That Pen explores alternative solutions. For pens that cannot be reused or refilled, the plastic and metal components are separated for recycling. The organization also engages in upcycling activities, transforming used pen parts into creative items like pen lamps and stationery holders. This not only reduces waste but also fosters a culture of creativity and sustainability. To further promote its mission, Save That Pen collaborates with partners and establishes pen recycling bins at various locations."

(Photo taken in February 2018, before COVID-19 pandemic)       What if we told you that going vegan does not necessarily mean giving up your favourite hotpot, chocolate cake or even yu sheng at Chinese New Year? And that Singapore in fact, has no dearth of appetising vegan options, being ranked the second-most vegan-friendly city in Asia?These are just some of the myths about veganism that NUS VEGE (Vision of Equality for a Greener Earth) hopes to dispel. Officially founded in AY 2020/2021 as an Interest Group for vegans, vegetarians, and anyone interested in reducing their consumption of animal products, NUS VEGE works to raise awareness about the ethical, environmental and health aspects of a plant-based diet and lifestyle, as well as educate the NUS community about the plight of animals and the environment caused by animal agriculture.Asked what he found most fulfilling about his choice to adhere to an environmentally sustainable vegan diet, outgoing NUS VEGE President Cody Lim, who is entering his final year at the NUS Business School, said, “The most rewarding aspect of adopting a plant-based diet is the knowledge that my diet helps animals, the environment, and my health, and also watching the people around me becoming more receptive towards a plant-based diet when dining with me.”Having been inspired by an ex-classmate to venture into a vegan lifestyle, NUS VEGE member Teng Chu Yu added, “Every plant-based advocacy you engage in and every plant-based choice you make accumulates into something larger, sparking deeper conversations about the implications of our dietary choices ","NUS VEGE (Vision of Equality for a Greener Earth) is an Interest Group for vegans, vegetarians, and anyone interested in reducing their consumption of animal products.
